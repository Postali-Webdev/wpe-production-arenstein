Theme usage instructions

This child theme has been created with additional features that align with our current website dev demands

To compile your SASS use the command compass watch from the command line in this themes directory

Slick has been included but commented out in the functions file, only enqueue this where necessary

header.php has been included with the mobile menu snippet, which is working and triggered from /js/scripts.js/

block-element.php is a base example of how to use a repeating design element through the website without coding it over and over, to call this block or any other just use the below php command
<php get_template_part('block', 'element');?>

Multiple blocks can be created and the tailing word can be changed, element is just used as placeholder text
